# Claude Code Setup Training Plan

**Project**: Spring Boot Book Management System
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide to understand the current Claude Code configuration
**Audience**: Developers, team members, and stakeholders exploring the project setup

---

## üéØ **Starting Point: Where to Begin**

**First File to Read:** `CLAUDE.md`
- Location: `/Basics_Lab_1/CLAUDE.md`
- Purpose: Primary Claude Code configuration file
- Contains: Development commands, architecture overview, agent summary
- Time needed: 5 minutes

**Why start here?** This file is what Claude Code reads first when working with your project.

---

## üìã **Complete Exploration Sequence**

### **Phase 1: Project Overview (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Read the main configuration
cat CLAUDE.md

# Check overall project structure
ls -la

# See what documentation folders exist
ls */README.md

# Quick architecture check
grep -A 5 "Architecture" CLAUDE.md
```

**What you'll learn:** Project scope, main commands, basic architecture

### **Phase 2: Active Claude Configuration (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Explore currently active agents (16 total)
find .claude/agents -name "*.md" | wc -l
find .claude/agents -name "*.md" | head -5

# Look at a sample agent
cat docs/claude-config/agents/development-review/code-reviewer.md

# Explore active commands (9 total)
find .claude/commands -name "*.md" | wc -l
find .claude/commands -name "*.md" | head -3

# Read command overview
cat docs/claude-config/commands/README.md

# Understand active vs dormant setup
cat .claude/README.md
```

**What you'll learn:** Current Claude capabilities, available commands, active vs dormant architecture

### **Phase 3: Business Understanding (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Read business requirements
cat docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md | head -30

# Check user stories
grep -E "US-[0-9]+" docs/requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md

# Understand architecture
cat docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md | head -30

# See project analysis
cat docs/analysis/README.md

# Check what the API does
grep -A 10 "API Endpoints" CLAUDE.md
```

**What you'll learn:** What the system does, user requirements, technical architecture

### **Phase 4: Enterprise Capabilities (Optional - 5 minutes)**
```bash
# See future scaling options
cat docs/claude-config/agents-enterprise/README.md

# Understand activation process
cat docs/claude-config/ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md | head -50

# Check dormant agent count
find .claude/agents-enterprise -name "*.md" | wc -l

# See dormant command count
find .claude/commands-enterprise -name "*.md" | wc -l
```

**What you'll learn:** Future capabilities, scaling strategy, enterprise readiness
