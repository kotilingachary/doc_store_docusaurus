## Rollback Plan

If things go wrong, here's how to quickly disable:

### Emergency Rollback (Immediate)
1. **Disable all workflows:**
   ```bash
   # Rename workflow files to disable
   cd .github/workflows
   for f in claude-*.yml; do mv "$f" "$f.disabled"; done
   git commit -m "Emergency: Disable Claude workflows"
   git push
   ```

2. **Stop in-progress runs:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Cancel all running Claude workflows

3. **Notify team:**
   - Post in team chat
   - Update status page if applicable

### Partial Rollback
- Disable specific workflow by renaming file
- Keep other workflows running
- Investigate issue with disabled workflow

### Re-enable After Fix
- Rename `.yml.disabled` back to `.yml`
- Test thoroughly before re-enabling
- Monitor closely after re-enable

---

## Budget & Resource Planning

### Initial Setup
- **Engineering Time:** 20-30 hours
