# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Book Management System - Bulk Upload Feature

### Document Information
- **Product**: Book Management System
- **Feature**: Bulk Book Upload
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-01-26
- **Status**: Approved for Development

---

## Executive Summary

The Book Management System currently supports individual CRUD operations for book records. This PRD outlines the requirements for adding bulk upload capabilities, allowing users to efficiently import large numbers of books via CSV and Excel files.

### Business Impact
- **Efficiency Gain**: Reduce book entry time from 2-3 minutes per book to bulk processing
- **User Satisfaction**: Address #1 user-requested feature (bulk import)
- **Scale Support**: Enable migration of existing book inventories from other systems
- **Error Reduction**: Automated validation reduces manual entry errors

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Manual Entry Inefficiency**: Users must create books one at a time through individual API calls
2. **Data Migration Barriers**: No easy way to import existing book inventories
3. **Time-Intensive Operations**: Large inventory setup requires hundreds of individual requests
4. **Error-Prone Process**: Manual entry increases likelihood of data entry mistakes

### User Feedback
> "We have 5,000 books in our existing Excel spreadsheet. Creating them one by one would take weeks." - Library Administrator
>
> "Our bookstore needs to quickly upload seasonal inventory changes. The current API isn't practical for bulk operations." - Bookstore Manager

## Product Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Enable Bulk Import**: Support CSV and Excel file uploads for book creation
2. **Maintain Data Quality**: Provide comprehensive validation with detailed error reporting
3. **Ensure Reliability**: Handle partial failures gracefully without data corruption
4. **Preserve Performance**: Process large files efficiently without blocking other operations

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 80% of new large customers use bulk upload within first month
- **Efficiency**: Average time to upload 1000 books < 30 seconds
- **Error Rate**: <5% validation failures on properly formatted files
- **User Satisfaction**: 90% satisfaction rating for bulk upload feature
